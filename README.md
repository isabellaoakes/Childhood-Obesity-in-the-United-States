## Project Description
By exploring peer-reviewed journals, I explored potential causes for the rise in childhood obesity as well as the consequences that come with it. The research shows that by discovering the causes, potential solutions can be created that can take into account differences in socioeconomic and racial identity differences. Statistical analysis was used to explore the change in childhood obesity over time, as well as differences in obesity rates between children with different racial identities.
